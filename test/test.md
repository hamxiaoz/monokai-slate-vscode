# An exhibit of Markdown

This note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.

Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.

Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.

1. Item 1
2. A second item
3. Number 3
4. â…£

URLs can be made in a handful of ways:

* A named link to [MarkItDown][2]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.
* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)
* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.

```js
const sum = [1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur);
```
You can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.

> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.
